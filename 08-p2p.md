Now we should be ready to do some communication. We can re-cycle some of the stuff we typed into hello.py. So let's copy it

~~~ {.python}
cp hello.py p2p.py
~~~

and then edit p2p.py. Let's get rid of the output line at the end, so we have:

~~~ {.python}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from mpi4py import MPI
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()
~~~

Let each process compute the square of it's rank and then send that message to rank0. This has rank 0 go through a loop over all numbers between 1 and the size-1

~~~ {.python}
if rank == 0:
    for index in range(1,size):
        data = comm.recv(source=index, tag=11)
        print (" Received from process ",index," : sq = ",data)
~~~

We're specifying the "source" of the message to be the loop index. We've arbitrarily chosen the tag to be "11" because there is only one message between a given pair of processes, so there's no danger of getting messages mixed up. Make sure you do the indentation right, though.  So this is what process 0 does. The others do the computation of the squares and a send, i.e. 

~~~ {.python}
else:
    sq=rank*rank
    comm.send(sq, dest=0, tag=11)
~~~

Make sure you have blank line above the "else" so that the loop is properly closed!  The tag is "11" again to make a match, and the destination is the root process rank 0. We don't have to specify length and type of the messages because Python is smart enough to figure that out.

~~~ {.python}
$ mpirun -np 8 ./p2p.py
 Received from process  1  : sq =  1
 Received from process  2  : sq =  4
 Received from process  3  : sq =  9
 Received from process  4  : sq =  16
 Received from process  5  : sq =  25
 Received from process  6  : sq =  36
 Received from process  7  : sq =  49
~~~

Note how everything is nicely in order. That is because we have rank 0 go through the loop one by one, i.e. it talks with one process after the other. If that sounds serial to you it's because it is. This is a general issue: communication tends to make things serial, so you should have as little of it as possible. And if you must have it, it's best to use collective operations where stuff happens inside a routine and chances are serializations such as this one has been kept to a minimum. There's tricks to do this but that's a bit beyond our scope here.
