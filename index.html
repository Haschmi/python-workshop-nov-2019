          <p>Modern Computers are often “parallel”, i.e. they have multiple processing units that can be taught to work together on a single application. Parallel computers range from multicore cell phones to huge clusters with hundreds of thousands of processors. Programming for such machines can be a daunting task. But a few basic principles can get you surprisingly far.</p>
<p>In this course we would like to give you a basic introduction into how to go about writing a parallel program, and then run it on a small parallel system. We’re using a system called “MPI” (Message Passing Interface) for this. There’s a few reasons why we’re using MPI to illustrate parallel programming:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>MPI works on any kind of parallel computer, irrespective of the details of the architecture;</li>
<li>It is very explicit, i.e. everything to do with parallel processing has to be “spelled out”;</li>
<li>Python bindings are available, so we can build on what we learned before; and</li>
<li>Although it is large and can get very complex, there’s a lot of simlifications we can make, and we get some good parallelism out of a handful of function calls.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that we won’t be able to make a parallel programmer out of you in a few hours. We’re just using this opportunity to give you an idea of what’s what. We encourage you to join the one or other of the “High-Performance Computing” courses that we offer, where we can go into much more detail.</p>
<p>The approach we are taking here is to work towards taking our “Mandelbrot Set” program that we developed in the Python Novice session, and “parallelize” it by letting multiple processors do parts of the overall work simultaneously.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this part of the workshops is a lot less hands-on than others. This is unavoidable: because we are going to introduce a lot of new concepts before we are ready to apply them, there’s going to be a lot more talking and a lot less typing. We’re trying to put the one or other exercise in there, but it won’t be before the “final hour” or so that we get to get around to the main task.</p>
<p>The stuff we did this morning is pretty much a prerequisit for this. We’ve got a version of the program we ended up with for you, so you won’t have to &gt; “start from scratch”. For the first few lessons we will use pre-made programs to demnstrate things.</p>

<p>All the required data and programs can be found in your home directory on your account</p>
<p>There is a folder (directory) parallel in your home directory. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:</p>
<pre class="input"><code>$ cd &amp;&amp; cd parallel</code></pre>
<p>Once you’re there you’re ready.</p>
